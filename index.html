  <h1>Unit 2</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Lesson 1: Welcome to the Internet</h2>
  <p>The goal of this lesson was to understand more about how networks work and how they are related to computers.</p>
  <h5>Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life? </h5>
  <h6>I'm using the internet when I need to ask a question about a certain topic. The purpose of this so I can be able to find answers that are shorter and more detailed. The role it has in my life is being updated on world issues and understanding myself, such as doing 16 Personality Tests.  </h6>
  <br>

  <h2>Lesson 2: Building a Network</h2>
  <p>The goal of this lesson was to learn more about networks and how data is transferred over these networks.</p>
  <h5>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D. </h5>
  <h6>The two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D are A to C to D,  C to B to D, or A to E to C to D.  </h6>
  <br>

  <h2>Lesson 3: The Need for Addressing</h2>
  <p>The goal of this lesson was to learn about what protocols make messaging over the internet possible.</p>
  <h5>Pick the two statements that are true about the Internet Protocol (IP). </h5>
  <h6>
    <ul>
      <li> Each device or computer on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address.</li>
      <li>IP is the shared way that all devices and computers label their messages with the sender and receiver's addresses.</li>
    </ul>
  </h6>
  <h5>Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet. </h5>
  <h6>The internet protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the internet by handling routing and addressing information, followed by data that can be sent across the internet through unique numbers,  IP addresses, to each connected device.  </h6>
  <br>

  <h2>Lesson 4: Routers and Redundancy</h2>
  <p>The goal of this lesson was to learn about different paths data can take over a network and why it's set up as such.</p>
  <h5>Pick Two: If the post office delivered mail exactly like the routers deliver messages on the Internet, which of the following statements would be true? </h5>
  <h6>
    <ul>
      <li> Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put inside envelopes.</li>
      <li>The mailman would sometimes take a different path to deliver each letter to your home.</li>
    </ul>
  </h6>
  <h5>What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy? </h5>
  <h6>The benefit of building redundancy into a network is having a backup plan when components fail by having one or one path. The potential issues with building redundancy some possible issues with building redundancy are that it can take up space and storage.  </h6>
  <br>

  <h2>Lesson 5: Packets</h2>
  <p>The goal of this lesson was to learn more about how data are separated into bits of information called packets, and how these packets work.</p>
  <h5>Which of the following is true regarding the way information is transmitted on the Internet? </h5>
  <h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.</li>
    </ul>  </h6>
  <h5>Terminology Matching</h5>
<span> 
  <h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Internet Protocol (IP): Rules for addressing and sending data across the internet by assigning unique numbers to each connected device.</li>
      <li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP: Takes inventory of all packets in the datastream to ensure they are successfully sent and received.</li>
      <li>Packet: Chunk of data and its metadata, used to route and reassemble information on the Internet.</li>
      <li>Datastream: The way in which information travels on the Internet, not as a single piece but in chunks.</li>
      <li>User Datagram Protocol: Sends all packets without checking whether they were received or ordered properly.</li>
    </ul>
  </h6>
</span>
  <br>

  
  <h2>Lesson 6: HTTP and DNS</h2>
  <p>The goal of this lesson was to learn more about how the World Wide Web works and how things such as websites are shared over it.</p>
  <h5>Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide Web. </h5>
  <h6>
    <ul>
      <li>The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using HTTP.</li>
      <li>HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet.</li>
    </ul>
  </h6>
  <br>
  <h5>What problem does the DNS solve? How does the DNS help the world wide web scale so that billions of users can access billions of web pages? </h5>
  <h6>The DNS solves the problem of translating domain names into IP addresses by keeping track of the IP addresses associated with the domain namesâ€“it helps us find the IP addresses of these domains by essentially asking other devices for the domain names and keeping them in a table. The DNS helps the internet scale by creating a system that helps with maintaining and keeping track of IP addresses. It keeps them interconnected and creates a distributed hierarchy which allows it to be administered differently; they remain interconnected, though.</h6>
