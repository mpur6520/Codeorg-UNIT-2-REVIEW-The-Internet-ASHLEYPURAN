  <h4>Unit 2 Digital Dilemma</h4>
  <h3>November 15th, 2022</h3>

  <br>
  
  <h1>CORE QUESTION</h1>
  <h3>When and how should resources be invested to close gaps between those who do and don’t use the Internet? </h3>
  
<p id="core">Resources should be spent when there is a noticeable gap between those who do and don’t have internet access–for example, when a place is constantly struggling with it. <br> Resources should be invested to close gaps between those who do and don’t use the internet by being put towards creating more areas where wifi routers, as well as technology, can be readily available.
</p>  

  <h2>IMPACTED GROUPS</h2>
  <table border="2" id="group">
    <tr>
      <th>Impacted Groups</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Those lacking in internet access/literacy.</li>
          <li>People in poverty</li>
          <li>Elderly who don't know how to use the internet</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td> Interests: more internet access and devices <br> This group suffers in departments such as education and economic factors because it's widely digitalized. This is somewhat of a benefit, because they won't be "addicted" and can focus on "other things".
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Students</li>
          <li>Low income neighborhood schools</li>
          <li>Various libraries</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>Interests: better access to internet, devices, becoming a spot with those things. <br> Libraries may be overcrowded with people who are seeking internet access or devices.<br> Schools in low income neighborhoods aren't as advanced as those in high income neighborhoods because they're unable to access a variety of good resources for learning.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Internet Service Providers</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>Interests: more business <br> They can be harmed because of the dilemma because there isn't enough people who are interacting as they can't afford/don't know how. <br> They can benefit from this because if people were to have devices required to access the internet, business could improve.</td>

  <h2>TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p id="tech"> The World Wide Web is accessed through a browser, which can happen due to the internet. The internet allows data and information to be spread from your physical device to other servers through HTTP (which lets you access webpages with information), sending information back and forth between a physical device and a server. This occurs through UDP or TCP, which allows data to be transferred (usually in packets) and reordered, making it easy to view websites and such. Processes such as these help improve the scalability of the internet. Some sort of connection is required for this to happen; it can't be without a router or wireless connection. Things regarding WiFi and routers are necessary here. This combined with a lack of digital awareness or physical devices to connect to the internet is a struggle in many places. This causes them to be left behind in social, economic, and political matter.</p>

  <br>
  
  <h2>RECOMMENDED POLICY</h2>
  <p>Pass a law that a certain percentage of taxes should be set towards helping close the digital divide.</p>

  <table border="2">
    <tr>
      <th>PROS</th>
      <th>CONS</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Those who can't afford devices will be given a sum in order to get those
devices.</li>
          <li>Funds can be set towards creating things such as libraries which then allows better access to the internet and said devices.</li>
          <li>
            Places with WiFi can be built in more public places, so internet access is easier on the go.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Some people may be upset that their taxes are going towards something that doesn't affect them.</li>
          <li>Some people might not want places to have more access to digital resources, because they prefer a lifestyle without technology involved.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
